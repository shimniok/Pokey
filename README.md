# Pokey

Pokey is the firefighting robot I entered into the 2007 Front Range Robotics Firefighting Challenge. It lost. But I've been
revising and improving it over the years.

I've also been using it to demonstrate robotics to lots and lots of children and quite a few adults at various robotics
expos like Robots At The Hangar, Denver Mini Maker Faire, and so on.  The kids love it. :)
